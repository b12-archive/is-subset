# Text editor configuration
# =========================
#
# This file describes the end-of-line character, indentation and other rules for text files â€“ in a
# format compatible with most text editors. It really helps to have all that consistent, without
# manual labor. You'll probably want a plugin for your editor. Go get one from
# [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org).
